* Reorganized file structure so that everything lives in vendor/extensions/rss_reader
* RssReader is now a module mixed in to all Page objects, so any page can make use of the feed tags and there is no longer an "Rss Reader" page type.
* cache directory is created on extension activation if none exists
* updated README to reflect new installation instructions + add more usage examples
