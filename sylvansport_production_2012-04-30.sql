We normally volunteer at a race that weekend and take all our bikes and camp at the fairgrounds. The event, Bike Days, is cancelled this year so we would be able to spend the entire weekend hanging out, Riding, sitting around the campfire and just being a family. We do have a vintage event in July and the Sylvan would be perfect for that . I know everyone at the swap meet and races would go wild over it and we could avoid hotels and have everything we need right at the track. It has been tough the last year and we won\'t be able to take a family vacation, the Sylvan Sport would make our weekends like a vacation!

We would spend 4 days in Mont Tremblant sight seeing and taking in the Ironman atmosphere and when it was all over, we would travel around eastern Canada throwing ourselves off cliffs, zooming down mountains around 30mph, throwing some tail whips and bar spins, and being soaking wet. We want to head over to Niagara falls to sight see and drift SCUBA dive down the Niagara River. Maybe stopping on the way for some white water rafting near Ottawa,where they also have bungee jumping. Both Lake Erie and Lake Ontario offer some great SCUBA diving as well. After returning back to the US, we want to hit up multiple downhill mountain bike parks including Seven springs, snowshoe Bike park, and Diablo Bike Park. Here we will get to enjoy some of the best east coast downhill mountain biking along with some freeriding. Doing all this while sleeping in relative comfort in a GO would be an amazing belated honeymoon for us both!','My husband is a little crazy when it comes to taking pictures and video. He has several contour video camera\'s that are always mounted on our mt bike helmets and would of course come with us on our adventure. I would even be willing to set one up on my triathlon bike to document the bike portion of the Ironman. Both of us spend alot of time on facebook and would post all parts of the adventure, especially the GO, everywhere we went. We also have a youtube account where our many mountain bike adventures, as well as mishaps (and trust me there are many) are displayed for all to see.

Â Those are plans already in the works, but the Go will make it even better. Â With the Go, I would plan to venture towards the Great Lakes and into Canada. Â Whole family trips and probably even more with my son are in the cards for the Berrys. Â \r\nA few week long trips would round out three months of weekly camping. Â My schedule is flexible, so we can venture out with the Go each and every week, blogging about it along the way.\r\nI want my kids and all those following along to see what an active, outdoor lifestyle is like, while traveling light for maximum adventure. Â I\'m not an anti-technology fiend by any stretch and think showing a healthy balance is essential. Â \r\nWe all long for adventure and for the outdoors.

My mission: to get people and their dogs going by introducing them to the amazing sport of lure coursing. I\'m dog-crazy (must be the *wolf* in my name) and I own a FL based lure coursing company that gets dogs active by letting them chase a lure around a field. I can\'t tell who has more fun, the dog or their owner, and it makes for a great day of exercise and socialization. Itâ€™s something the entire community can get into. I\'d pre-select 10 destination cities and hit the road with my GO, lure course machine, and my little dog Pretzel. In between stops Iâ€™d visit animal shelters to help spread the word about adoption and the importance of responsible pet ownership. Lure coursing is fast, fun, and you\'re in control. People love their dogs, but sometimes they just can\'t provide the exercise Fido needs. This activity is the best boredom breaker; it\'s instant fun - no training involved. Once you and your dog have tried it, you\'re hooked, and it\'s a great activity to share with your friends and fellow dog-lovers.

Just last month my lure coursing events graced the Florida Today Sunday newspaper! http://www.floridatoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2012303040038 Furthermore, Iâ€™d be holding public events in each city.

Anyone interested in joining me on a sea kayaking plus camping trip into a national park off the west coast of British Columbia, Canada. Clayoquot Sound holds a cluster of islands emerging from sea on edge of North America which delineates the border of Vancouver Island and the Pacific. It is during peak summer season on the west coast including 2 holidays â€œOh Canada Dayâ€ and â€œ4th of July.â€ Whales, porpoises, eagles, deer, black bears, and many interesting shorebirds abound around the island. Gigantic white sand beaches are waiting for you to explore. This is not a trip for beginning kayak paddlers; Intermediate to experienced paddlers will enjoy this adventure and you will need a passport. Getting there should be half the fun, a lightweight camper like the Sylvan Sport Go would work well when leaving Chicago behind and crossing the Rocky Mountains. We are not done with heights to scale as on Vancouver Island there is still the Golden Hinde, at 7,201 ft on the way to the sea. Accommodations on the island in high season leads to high prices so camping out is the best way to go. All told from the Plain States it would be about a 3 week camping trip, so come on along','Afterwards you will be invited to the slide show presentation to see you through the cold winter months at the Mad City Paddlers monthly potluck dinners.

You see, when we got to the top of the Mountain path, we didn\'t stop, we had to see what was down the other side.  I have always been an avid hiker, however a few years back I graduated into mountain biking as well.  I always look forward to my next biking adventure in the mountains and if I were given the opportunity to use a GO, then that would be exactly what I would do.  The Go would be perfect to haul the 6 bikes we take to the mountains without the concerns of faulty bike racks on the interstate (a hole other story!).  I would take my Go stuffed with bikes to the Cataloochie Valley, NC.  For those who don\'t know the area, you have to drive over a mountain on a single wide rock road to get to the valley, and no 37ft. 5th Wheel Camper is going to get there!

It seems every year we end up watching the drama unfold on television together, dreaming of a time when we would be able to cheer on the pros from the crest of Alpe d\'Huez or the frenzy of the Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es. Winning this opportunity with the SylvanSport GO and all of the amazing equipment would outfit us with everything we could possibly need for the cycling adventure of a lifetime. It would also allow us to bring bikes and scout each section, and would be the perfect mode of transport and lodging to stake our location along the course each day and revel in the best cycling has to offer. (note: if we are limited to the adventure taking place in the US or Canada, the adventure would remain the same, but it would be tied around the US Pro Cycling Challenge in Colorado, a prestigious second-year event in 2012 that attracts top professional cyclists and live television coverage on NBC Sport Network)','My dad and I would look to set up camp each day in a visible location that would assure at least minimal TV exposure.

In addition, I would blog and create short vignettes each day about the location in which we stay, as well as the trip to get there and how the SylvanSport GO makes it easy.

Hiking and camping along the north rim of the Grand Canyon taking in the superb views and endless trails, followed by a climb of the 70ft watchtower at Desert View Point for a perfect panorama of the natural wonder.  After packing up camp and reloading the GO we head north to Utah to meet up with some fellow mountainboarders!  The summer paths of Park City and nearby Deer Creek State Park offer some of the best trail riding and beautiful scenery in the state.  As an added bonus the winds coming down the canyon create one of the best inland kiteboarding destinations for big jumps and smooth cruising!  With more than enough room in the GO all of our boards, kites, and gear would be ready when we are!  Next itâ€™s off to Jackson Hole Wyoming for some whitewater kayaking on the Snake River.  With its spectacular mountain vistas and abundant wildlife itâ€™s hard to not feel at peace with the world.  Camping in Yellowstone and mountain biking the Lower Geyser Basin would all be perfectly accomplished and create memories of a lifetime with the help of the GO.','To truly document such an epic adventure it surely needs to be seen.  I would capture each activity and opportunity using my two GoPro cameras as well as my Canon 5D MarkII.  My intent would be to highlight how the GO has contributed to the convenience, comfort, and excitement of the experience.  Putting pen to paper (or fingers to the keyboard) I would create engaging blog posts about each stop of the trip as well as the bumps, detours, and jokes along the way.

I would love to explore and hike the magical Olympic National Park, home to one of North Americaâ€™s only temperate rainforests. From there I would kayak the coast of Washington, and hopefully see Orca whales. I have a reverent fear of these whales, and being able to Kayak alongside them would be an utterly life altering experience. From Washington I would then road trip my GO and gear to Yellowstone National Park, and hopefully find a new friend or two to go boldering and see the sights with. Next I would love to travel to the southeastern United States, an area I have never visited before. I would leave my options open, as I know I would come in contact with many interesting people in this trip that had different things to offer. The most important part of a trip like this would be the people I met along the way, and something everyone has in common is a need for food. I would LOVE to find new creative ways to cook meals from ingredients that are local to wherever Iâ€™m staying, and feeding as many new friends as possible. Oh the places I might go with my SylvanSport GO and gear!','I am a recording engineer, so the sights AND sounds of my travels would be recorded. I would use my unique experiences to capture authentic, natural sound effects for my use, and the use of others in the audio engineering field. I am also an avid home videographer, and have the gear and editing skills to produce regular vlogs about my life on the road. Photography is a passion of mine as well, and documenting the beauty of everyday life is something I excel at. I believe life is well lived only in the company of others, so sharing my adventure would be a top priority for me. The GO is a natural conversation starter, and my background in public speaking and customer service puts me in a comfortable position to talk to anyone. The Internet is a broad tool that can reach so many people worldwide, but I find that connections truly start on a person-to-person basis. If chosen, traveling with the GO would give me the utter freedom to connect with people in both ways.

I would start in Tahoe, do some kayaking, mountain biking and river rafting in the American river and travel down through the California Delta to kayak and swim. I would also stop in Yosemite to do some climbing and to hike half dome (One of my goals since I was 14 or so.) After Yosemite Iâ€™d go down to Sequoia Park and do some hiking and sight seeing. Then Iâ€™d cruise down the 5 and head through the los Padres national forest and do plenty of mountain biking, camping and hiking there. Taking the 33 through the Los padres Iâ€™d stop in Ojai to do some hiking and climbing. From there Iâ€™d take the PCH to the Leo Carrillo campground and stay in Malibu for a few days. Iâ€™d travel to Joshua tree after that and stop and meet up with a few friends who live in San Diego to do some climbing. From Joshua Tree ','I have a Go Pro, and access to internet media sharing sites. I would post videos on Facebook, youtube, and tweet links on twitter.

This is a backcountry desert beauty packed with unclimbed and untouched wilderness. Step 1: Base camp upstream at the San Rafael River. Step 2: Load as much climbing gear as possible, harness the puppy, stow the camera, and set off with a map and a little courage. Step 3: Imagine a clear, winding river cutting through vibrant sandstone cliffs. Every thousand feet, a dry wash leads opens and bends just out of sight. Each wash deserves more time than I can give it â€“ but I have not yet earned the right to their secrets. We are but acquaintances, but I feel a spark of something more. Step 4:  Riverside base camp. A dayâ€™s time will be enough to prioritize the opportunities. I come with the tools to succeed, the will to succeed, and the courage to fail. The remoteness -breathtaking. The climbing-rough and sandy. I learn the rock, learn its weaknesses, its strengths, its story. Darkness falls and back to camp I trek.  I will be back. Step 5: A little further down-river I wander. Step 6:  Riverside base camp. Repeat. Step seven: Repeat. I lose myself then I find myself in the Swell.  ','I love taking photos.

We canoe, kayak, bike and do motorcycle travel.\r\n\r\nWe have \'down sized\' from a big truck and 5th wheel camper and are now ready and anxious for smaller, and more economical travel.  Our car gets 28-30 mpg in regular travel.  Our \'green goal\' is to get 22-25 mpg for this trip!!  What a kick, travel thousands of miles and get great mileage.\r\n\r\nOur dream trip would be to follow the Pacific coast south from Alaska, BC, the inside passage, Vancouver Island, the San Juan\'s, Washington, Oregon and California coasts into Mexico following the Baja coast 925 miles to La Paz.  three countries, one coast. There would be be time for exploration by kayak, canoe and hiking while camping along the way.\r\n\r\nThe greatest adventure of all is to....START!!!  Traveling with the GO would be the start of a perfect dream for us.\r\nGene Sacha','We travel with a smart phone, laptop, digital camera, GPS.  A  locator beacon will make it possible to find us anywhere along our route.  We will pre-publish the route early blog logs.  We will publish daily blogs with pictures from our laptop, much like our e mail diaries from China.\r\n\r\nPeople are wonderfully curious and friendly. In a campgroud they are often seeking \"something new\", \"something different\" and the GO meets this criteria. People will stop, stare, interruptus and seek information on the innovative GO.\r\n\r\n A green mileage travel goal, magnetic signs on the car announcing our travel goal and blog address we believe to be great attention getters. People still want to travel and they are frustrated by high fuel costs. This dream trip is a very practical real time example of the joys of traveling small and taking it all with you and GOing.','','','','','520-490-8995',71,1,'2012-04-09 23:51:14','2012-04-09 23:51:14','5475 W Lazy Heart St','','Tucson','AZ','85713','male','Sylvansport web site'),

My kids would experience the magic of the Rocky Mountains up close and personally.  We would hike many trails and learn about the beauty of our great country.  My kids would experience waterfalls for the fist time and encounter wildlife they\'ve only read about.  We would enjoy meeting other families in  campgrounds.  Lifelong memories would be created by traveling through destination states.  We would run through the mountains in route to Redwood National Forest.  The GO would provide some great photo ops among the great Sequoias.   This family of five would have just as much fun returning from our outstanding vacation.  Our kids would beg us to \'unplug\' for another grand GO adventure. ','We would create and upload a travel blog about our adventures.  As an elementary teacher, I would work with my children to write and draw about their exciting experience on the GO.  We would share and upload our discoveries.

When my siblings and I were younger, my parents bought a used tent trailer to continue the family tradition.  The catch was, since the pop-up trailer was â€œaffordableâ€ it didnâ€™t have a functional lifting mechanism.  Thatâ€™s when my dad invented his â€œNorwegian Lifting Systemâ€.  It consisted of sets of 4 wood 2x2\'s, cut to specific lengths for propping the corners of the trailer up.  As luck would have it, there are four kids in my family, so my dad would place us at the corners of the trailer, lift a side, weâ€™d insert our wood supports and then heâ€™d move on to the next side.  Heâ€™d continue this around the trailer until weâ€™d have the trailer lifted to full height and then finally the actual camping, fishing and hiking adventures could begin.\r\nMy wife and I are expecting our first child this summer and we plan on continuing that tradition with our new addition as soon as possible. I also regularly participate in mountain bike races throughout Arizona and would love to not have to cram the bikes and gear into the back of a vehicle!','We take way too many pictures.   After living in Nepal for a year, we decided to take a 7 week trip home through Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and then to visit friends in Alaska before returning to Arizona.  From that trip alone we have over 10,000 pictures.  We plan on documenting our future adventures with the Go trailer with our trusty Sony DSLR as well our video camera now that we have a new addition to the family on the way.

Then it would be up through the Rocky Mountain National Park to Estes Park for another campout, and a tour of the haunted Stanley Hotel.  Next, we would proceed North into Wyoming and the Grand Tetons for three nights in three different campgrounds, to include and a quick circuit and half-day hikes in the Yellowstone National Park.  After all that fun, and an experience these kids will NEVER forget, we would retrace our steps back to Avon with a two day stopover in the Rocky Mountain National Park for two or three more day hikes.  Our final camp stop would be in Glenwood Springs for a day at the hotsprings and a thorough clean-up so the kid\'s parents would be able to recognize them.

Those kids that have twitter accounts, etc. would broadcast daily reports of their experience.

We drove from our home in Pearland Texas and camped in parks along the way.  I had a Coleman Inflatable Kayak mailed to me and it was waiting for me when we got there.  My plan was to kayak the Uncompahgre River.  \r\nWhere I put in it was calm with just a little rapid here and there.  Then I heard something like a freight train coming at me and wondered what in world it could be, and where was this sound coming from? Cruising on down the river I came to a high wall on a bend and there I found six to eight foot high waves in the water roaring like all hell had broke loose.  What in Godâ€™s name was I thinking!  What could I do?  I paddled as hard as I could, tried to steer but in reality I was at the mercy of the river, and my life was in Godâ€™s hands.  Funny thing was, I just bobbled up and down on the waves and shot straight through like it was nothing.  Still I was terrified, and could hardly wait until I could do it again!  On our way home we took a white water rafting tour of the Royal Gorge. It couldnâ€™t compare. \r\nOur next trip we want to do a North American rollercoaster tour while camping out in state and National Parks along the way.  \r\n','On our next trip we will take our bikes, and if we can get one, a Sea Eagle Explorer kayak.  The plan is follow the outline of a Google Maps â€œget directionsâ€ line from our house in Pearland to Sandusky Ohio where the great â€œMillennium Forceâ€ awaits.  I know there are other parks along the way and if our GPS says here is an amusement park then if we have the money and the time we will stop.  Each stop along the way we will film with Katâ€™s I-phone documenting everything we do.  Since she is 4g we can post directly to my our individual Facebook accounts and to one of my Youtube accounts.  In the Ozarks there is so much water and so many hills to climb *we have climbing and rappelling gear too!*  that it may be hard to move on; however, Millennium Force is our destiny and we shall tarry on!  Katherine is a ninth grade Biology teacher and really needs her vacation time!  She lives for the opportunity to ride rollercoasterâ€™s, and claims Millennium Force is the greatest one in North America.  I like Superman at Fiesta Texas.

We would love to use this all over the remote parts of Ak, as well as on our travels to visit family & friends all over the world. We have dreamed of a camper like this for years and have finally found one to take us anywhere! Thank you for the imagination that has gone into building this work of art. My husband has talked about teaching me to rock climb and with our son nearing the age of being able to learn as well, this is our next big trip. We plan on rock-climbing around the Nation the next time we do our road trip to meet family along our way to Florida. The fact that this will save on hotel rooms, scrunched back seats, & gas is so exciting.  We are also avid motorcyclists and can\'t wait to be able to do more than one or two things on a trip, having them be short trips or wasting gas by having to have more than 1 vehicle. A camper like this will help us to make an adventure happen any time.','For all of our travels with our son we have planned on having him take pictures & video of the things that we do & the new people that we meet as well as write about what these people & cultures have meant & what he learned from them so that he can create an essay to share with children in his class to help everyone in our small community of 800 people get an idea of all the people & cultures around the world. we live in a tiny little mining town & people don\'t get out too much when the temperature drops below -25F. To be able to have these videos and photos to share with everyone is an idea that we had to get everyone together when it is so frigid & people seem to keep to themselves. This type of thing can help with the depression that may set in from the lack of conversation & community when it is too cold to stay outside. we shared photos of our travels on our website while away which has been so great to get feedback on. we are excited to continue this during future travels.','','Dana Whinery','','','907-378-2444',28,1,'2012-04-13 07:14:44','2012-04-13 07:14:44','po box 204','','Denali National Park','Alaska','99755','female','I heard about this contest through the life changing FLYlady.'),

Maybe not QUITE the moon, but closeâ€”the deepest heart of the American southwest, in all its otherworldly glory. Itâ€™ll be a remote, full-sensory journey: coyote song as the sun slips behind the rim of a canyon; the slickrock slither of alligator lizards; the scent of sagebrush and the grippy feel of sandstone under hiking boots. This trip has been in the works for a few months already, but the GO is the perfect excursion module to make our exploration complete!  Weâ€™ll set out on an 11-day tour of southern Utah and northern Arizona to photograph the strange and beautiful landscape of White Pocket with its hoodoos and sandstone waves, the hidden slot canyons of Grand Staircase-Escalante; kayak remote fingers of Lake Powell, and explore the red rock beauty of Arches National Park.  Weâ€™ll put the GO through its paces off road (but nothing TOO gnarly), hitched to our Jeep Liberty 4x4.  Weâ€™ll load it up with our mountain bikes, the kayaks, and all the goodies the GO will carry to let us live like royalty in the wilderness.

Though Iâ€™ve driven across Canada, east & west, this time I think weâ€™ll go via the States.  Weâ€™d head out from Toronto, ON to Sidney, OH, to pick up the SylvanSport GO & hopefully meet the makers.  From there hit cities such as Chicago, IL, Mount Rushmore, SD, Yellowstone National Park, MT.  Hook up with friends in Vancouver, BC & head to Tofino to try out the surfing.  Route back thru Canada & hit some our parks especially Algonquin in my own home province.  3 weeks full on & then smaller adventures to cover the 3 months use or can it be shared?  Weâ€™ll definitely take advantage of it & considering we have all the gear to camp, it would definitely help â€˜cos instead of paying for dodgy hotels, weâ€™ll be using the money for petrol.  How can anyone complain about that?  It will be luxury camping at itâ€™s finest.

I have a Pinterest account but no we donâ€™t have a blog but hey how hard can it be, hello WordPress!  Our phones are crap but I do have a camera, so weâ€™ll be able to post & email our friends with words & pictures.  Thereâ€™s always free Wifi somewhere!  Our friends & family will be eager to know about our mishaps, â€˜cos there always are.  Weâ€™ll be sure to interject about the different products we used during the day, take pictures of us using the product & share our thoughts on the product.  Since my friend is from the UK & Iâ€™m from Canada, youâ€™ll get double exposure as well as we have friends from other countries.  Since weâ€™ll be doing a more nature based vacation our audience will be suited for the products.  Weâ€™ll give out product promos, plaster stickers where possible & tell people how all the products came to us.  Weâ€™ll even hit retail store circuit.

Although satisfying for most during the weekday there are those who chose the outdoors for recreation, relaxation, and entertainment.  Visiting National and State parks is educational and exciting.  Camping, hiking and photography are key elements on any adventure.  If given the opportunity for more than just a weekend my adventure would include going from the desert in New Mexico into the mountains of Colorado then east to find the Appalachian mountains.  It would be amazing seeking out the lush greenery of the eastern shores and follow the coast to the Canadian border.  Visiting the Great Lakes for the first time sounds fun.  The journey along the border across to the Pacific Ocean searching for the perfect sunset alone would be worth the trip.  There must be countless opportunities to see wildlife while traveling through the upper United States.  Once in California one can only imagine camping on the beach before wrapping up the trip.  ','Facebook is a wonderful thing, if you want people to follow what you are doing.  It is a great place to post pictures and keep a blog on how things are going while on trips.

I think our first of many adventures would be to go back and be able and stay in our Go. To fly fish the area again and stay in the go would be a dream come true. We think we are the coolest couple we know and we really would be pulling the GO with all our gear on top.We say to always live your best life and this would really make our dreams come true. We would love to show off the GO!!!',' If we won the goal we would be more than happy to make a blog of our adventures and post it on Face Book.

She traveled for 3 months camping out of the GO exploring remote canyons, lakes and rivers. She saw the wilderness areas of Arizona, Utah, Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. Katie kayaked through the slot canyons in Lake Powell. She swam in the tropical water of Havasu. She even hiked The Wave in Coyote Buttes. You haven\'t seen it? It\'s incredible! I felt like I was there as I followed her photos and stories on her daily blog. She makes me want to get outside and explore! What an adventure! She explored the rocky mountains in Vancouver. Backpacked and climbed through New Brunswick. Saw some scenery I didn\'t know existed! She even posted photos of her climbing canyon walls in Zion National Park â€“ you can\'t match a view like that! She visited Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks. Sometimes she stopped to rest in places like Lava Hot Springs in Idaho. You really should stop by her blog. Reading it opened my eyes to the world and empowered me to explore and travel more. It was really life changing for her. She explains the lessons she learned along the way. So inspirational','Following Katie\'s adventures was so cool. Every day I logged onto FB + Twitter and saw her hiking, backpacking and kayaking through her photos and blog posts. The ladies in her climbing groups LOVED her climbing stories (facebook.com/Womens.Climbing.Retreat + Twitter: @WomenClimbing). She such an inspiration for women\'s empowerment and adventure! She shared her lessons with us each day from simply remembering to breath to stepping out of your comfort zone and everything in between. She encouraged me to get outside and FEEL the world in ways that so many people don\'t take the time to experience. Or take for granted. The sponsors of the contest posted her blogs as well! She\'s making friends all across the US! She even did product reviews of the swag she won, which was helpful because I need some of it for my travels! She even took video with the GoPro for the truly rad experiences.

As other teamâ€™s noticed our organization system we would explain to them how it worked, and encouraged them to take pictures and make a similar systemâ€”the GO is such a unique system, that I could imagine that any event we would take it to would gather similar attention and we would be in a prime situation to tell others about it and provide them with information.\r\n\r\nFurther, both of us are adept at using social mediaâ€”Iâ€™ve kept blogs during personal travels, we both use Facebook, and Bobby works in the Search Engine Optimization field.

	(593,'Elizabeth','Lariviere','elariviere11@gmail.com','With a brand new Sylvan Sport Go filled with all the finest gear, I will GO to Heaven! It begins at Cape Hopewell in New Brunswick, Canada, where I will kayak the great tides at the Bay of Fundy, as well as walk the ocean floor while staring up at the floating islands. Followed by a quick drive down into the very wild and remote side of Maine where I will spend my days camping around the Penobscot and Kennebec River, trying my hand at fly fishing and of course catching a ride in those big yellow whitewater rafts. However, I donâ€™t want to raft on just any day, the Monday after the 4th of July is ideal or September 8th or 22nd. On that day the Kennebec River is turned into a giant washing machine, water is released at 8000cfs. Not just an adventure, but an adrenaline high. Thatâ€™s why I love the state of Maine but I never get to experience the outdoors fully. So with the Go, my favorite place will be transformed into a dream come true. There is so much to do in the northeast that quite frankly I just want to do it all.','When I get my new Go, I will tell everyone how much I love it, how versatile it is, and how easy it is to set up. I will announce my love for the coolest camper ever by making it known on Facebook; I will pollute my wall with photos and stories. Hell, if I win a Go I will start a twitter account just for the occasion. I will write all over my Honda Element that â€œI Won a Go.â€ No matter where I am, everyone shall know, but they probably wonâ€™t have to read my truck because I will never want to go anywhere without my Sylvan Sport Go.','','facebook.com/elariviere11','','','317-918-9178',26,1,'2012-04-18 23:49:28','2012-04-18 23:49:28','1945 Lafayette Ave','Apt. 1D','Lebanon','IN','46052','female','I saw it posted on Sylvan Sports facebook wall.'),

Itâ€™s dark and raining.  Weâ€™re relieved it only takes moments to remove our gear and set up the camper with sleeping bags.  Rachel sleeps on her travel pillow. We carry both into the camper to stay dry. The next morning I Go for an early coastal bike ride with headlamp to see the sunrise. Hubby still sleeps.  I return to my boys carving wooden spoons and Go eat our breakfast of oatmeal and coffee.  My daughter huddles on a stump wrapped in cozy down. Hubby still sleeps. We don shoes that Go from rugged woods to water like our camper, and geocache with our GPS. We see remnants of the fire. When we return, hubbyâ€™s still asleep. The boys help me lug the Kayak and we Go to the Lake.  We don wet suits, hoodies, and take turns paddling the frigid water near the shore before returning. Heâ€™s still sleeping. I hang up the hammock and attempt to wake him. Maybe we should Go back to sleeping on the ground-  This starts our testudine adventure from Minnesota.Our plan: to explore National Parks along the West Coast carrying home on our back.','Time to wake up! Iâ€™ve got the video camera on hubby as he â€˜staysâ€™ sleeping in his Go. Weâ€™ll be videotaping our adventure, capturing dadâ€™s crazy morning hair and momâ€™s big rump climbing Mt Whitney. Kids are ready to traverse fallen logs, bike the Southwest and swim anywhere.We send daily updates on facebook and twitter to appease the mother-in-laws\' insatiable appetite for information, and the teacher in me requires daily journal entries. Ultimately these contribute to our family movie. Fortunately, hubby is a video scrapbooking master! He\'ll edit our pictures and video into a visual story including soundtrack from his various 5000 I-pod songs.  Itâ€™s Warren Miller meets the Duncans (Good Luck Charlie).

I would also set the world record for how many dirt bags would for in a GO. And Iâ€™m sure the King at Kingâ€™s Canyon wouldnâ€™t mind seeing how good the GO works off road. I would then GO north to Yosemite and Northern California to find Yogi and Booboo by leaving out a lunch basket after our kayak trip through some rivers and lakes. From there I GO east to the canyons of Zion and Bryce to do some canyoneering. Since I would be near the Grand Canyon, a short diversion would be nice to hike down to the canyon and back up again. On my way back south, I would have to GO by Vegas and take in the sights. Unfortunately as a poor person, I canâ€™t afford a room so I would just pay the valet to park the GO next to some nice cars in front of the hotel, and make the other car owners jealous of how versatile the GO is, and how much less I paid. After getting no sleep in Vegas, I would drink too many 5-hour energy drinks and drive all the way back home.','Documenting the adventure is the easy part. I would make sure to moon people along the way so they would pay attention to me and my amazing camper. I may have to play some obnoxiously loud music at the campsites about how having a GO is like it being a Friday every day and video me dancing and singing to it to put on YouTube. I think it will be the newest viral video. Hey, if Rebecca Black can do it I can do it better. Nothing would advertise the GO better than a myriad of annoying facebook and twitter posts every hour of how amazing my life is and that I am the most interesting man in the world. Of course for the more traditional folk I would post pictures and video as well as blog about my experience on my website that gets about 100,000 hits a month because of my last viral video of me crying after seeing a double rainbow.

I haven\'t had much exposure to this area but what parts I have managed to explore have really blown me away with some of the most stunning scenery and amazing Native American petroglyphs, and kivas to look at and explore.  The area is very diverse and allows for hiking, backpacking, camping, kayaking and mountain biking, all things at least one of us does for fun.  I have been looking forward to kayaking Labyrinth Canyon since I saw some of the stunning photos from a group trip.  The perfect kiva is stunning and well worth a trip out to see as are the petroglyphs in the area.  We have both wanted to mountain bike the rim trail in Canyonlands\' Island in the Sky.  Such awe inspiring scenery.  There really is so much to this area that it is hard to describe everything.

The trip will progress across the U.S. with stops in some of the most beautiful countryside America has to offer.','I plan to contact the website www.lewisandclarktrail.com to help plan and promote the trip.  I also plan to personally document my trip by creating a blog on Travellerspoint, a website I have used in the past to plan trips and converse with other travelers and adventurers around the world.  If necessary I will create a twitter account for fans of the Sylvan Sport Go to converse with me while on my adventure.  Lastly, I will photograph and video document my trip of which Sylvan Sport will have full access to at the completion of my trip.','','','','','8502931375',28,1,'2012-04-21 02:35:16','2012-04-21 02:35:16','1667 College Parkway','','Gulf Breeze','FL','32563','female','I think it was indirectly through Pinterest and the Tiny House Listings website.

Itâ€™s a rite of passage!\r\nI have not seen much of the western states, and would love to take my family on a month long camping tour!\r\nThere are so many wonderful national parks in the western states. I chose several which would be family friendly as well as allow us to take advantage of all of my familyâ€™s varied hobbies. Weâ€™ll start off from Seattle heading south to Portland â€“ where weâ€™ll stay in Cannon beach â€“ for some Kite Flying and beach combing. Next weâ€™ll hit Crater Lake for some swimming and kayaking! Our next stop is Yosemite National Park where stay for several days, taking in the sights, biking, Hiking and horseback riding. Weâ€™ll stop by Kings Canyon National Park on our way to the Grand Canyon. Weâ€™ll spend about a week at the Grand Canyon. From there, weâ€™ll make our way to a campground near Grand Teton National Park and Yellowstone National Park.\r\nFinally, we\'ll take the boys to Silverwood Theme Park.

I have a vision of creating a car camping blog which covers a number of topics for new car campers and parent campers with children.\r\nIâ€™ll be shooting the webisodes using a Tripod mounted Canon 60D, capturing audio using wireless lapel microphone, and Iâ€™ll have a lighting rig. \r\nCamping starts long before the engine starts. How do you help a new person plan a camping trip? How do you help someone enjoy it and want to do it again? Webisodes will include the basics about matching campsites with the camper, helping to select activities and cover the basics on equipment selection. Weâ€™ll touch on food, but I suspect this will be an ongoing and â€˜space fillerâ€™.\r\nOnce at the camp site, weâ€™ll cover setting up the camp, setting up the tent (and the Go!), and setting up the kitchen. Weâ€™ll cover activities such as cooking, cleaning.\r\nThe modern child has much to keep their attention.

The idea of ultimate adventure would be a trek through Texas for a couple of nights at the Palo Duro canyon where we would take in the beautiful Texas sky, deep within the beautifully carved cliffs of the canyon.  Departing from Texas, we would make our way to the mountains of New Mexio for a stay in Red River. Once In Red River we would visit a campground where I spent time as a kid filling our mornings with trout fishing, afternoons with a hike through the mountains and evenings by the campfire. The week would epresent a great escape from a life that gets far too wrapped up in work and living on the run.

Videos would include hauling down the road, packing the go, setup and takedown, inside and outside tours, features and so forth. This would be designed to gives viewers the ultimate firsthand experience as to how an everyday family can take the GO and enjoy everything that it has to offer. Secondly, I would create a twitter account and document our trip along the way so that family, friends and business contacts could witness our journey firsthand.

Weâ€™ve been shopping for infant PFDs because this year we hope to try getting her on the kayaks with us. We enjoy paddling a local lake (Jordan) and swimming in the summer sun. I cannot wait to see how she reacts to that much water, considering how she loves to splash in the tub.\r\nHaving a GO would allow us to branch out further and easily stay with an infant in places where it would be  more difficult with our 2-person mesh tent. So my GO Adventure would include traveling to all kinds of destinations in the hopes of allowing our daughter to experience so many different things â€“ zoos, beaches, mountains, even baseball games! Our job now is to continue to make the most of our lives while including her at every level, and camping is one of those things a family can easily do together to make BIG memories. Thanks!','Since the birth of our daughter weâ€™ve take over 14,000 pictures (thank God for digital!) and posted at least 50% of those for family in other states to view. We typically Skype with the Grandparents and email is a daily thing. So, if we went on our GO Adventure I am sure there would be thousands of pictures to be posted. Our iPhones would even allow picture and video posting in real time â€“ as long as we have a signal. I tried to keep a blog up-to-date before our daughter was born but have since lost the time for that. It would be fun to fire it back up.','http://jim.looneys.org/','','http://www.youtube.com/user/jrlooney','https://twitter.com/#!/jrlooney','919.401.5090',39,1,'2012-04-24 11:09:30','2012-04-24 11:09:30','5314 Fortunes Ridge Dr.','','Durham','NC','27713','male','I\'m on your e-mailing list.'),

We creeped along at a snailâ€™s pace while I waited for him to catch up. Then we found a toad on the path. He started asking questions about it and soon we were discussing the natural world around us. His discontent turned into curiosity. We werenâ€™t hiking any faster, but instead of stopping to complain, my son was asking about the plants, rocks, streams, animals; anything that he saw he immediately excited him. We continued hiking for hours, talking about nature, about caring for it and experiencing it. I told him about some of the great things that I have seen like the Adirondacks and the Smokeys. I told him about wild rivers and cascading waterfalls. I told him about seeing bears and buffalo. I told him about kayaking, biking, climbing and backpacking. The more we talked the more I could see the passion for the outdoors growing inside him. In that moment, in the middle of that trail, my son and I connected with each other, with creation, and with the Creator.\r\nA GO would allow me to keep my family passionate about the outdoors and adventure.','I recently purchased a GoPro camera to take around on my adventures.

Now as a single foster parent who is trying to adopt, it is tougher as my little one is 6 years old.  We have to go to places easily accessible.  Boat landings, camp grounds, and state parks.  I am getting tired of â€œBack Yardâ€ camping.  Having a GO would let us go down Ranger trails pulled by the 4wheeler.  It would allow us to take our gear and have a safe place to stay.  I have 1 little one with me at the moment, but could have up to 4. I would love to take them camping, kayaking and hiking for the little time I might have them.  I want to show them that there is a world outside of the house to explore.  A place under the stars that they can grow and learn about how life should be.  Most of my kids cant swim, have never been in a boat, and havenâ€™t heard of camping.   I spend most of my money on the children,  they get all the state gives them spent on them as well, 11 dollars a day.  So I have little to splurge with, and having a GO would mean we donâ€™t need a motel.  I want for them,  I have been there, they haven\'t.

They will see children healing and learning about the wilderness and the oceans, one trip at a time.  They will know the joys of traveling light, and staying where the stars are your night light.  My kids, and I call them mine, don\'t know much beyond someone yelling at them, or hitting them, or abusing them till I get them.

Now six, he has become an avid explorer: skiing, cycling, hiking, camping, bouldering, and stand-up paddleboarding.  Our first two-week unsupported bike tour (camping) is later this summer. A move back to back East gives us the opportunity for an extended traverse across the West.  \r\n     When we first saw the GO we liked the ability to haul gear â€“ with our 4WD crossover and a light trailer we will be able to reach places off the beaten track â€“ and then quickly make camp so we can spend our time exploring, which would enable us to embark on a trip across the National Parks of Utah â€“ introducing our favorite spots in Zion, paddling Canyonlands\' Green River, horseback riding at Bryce Canyon, going deep into Cathedral Valley to climb at Capitol Reef.  We plan on some mountain biking in Moab as well.',' We already maintain a blog on raising our son, in particular emphasizing our outdoor adventures, which entries we usually link to on G+ and Facebook.

In order to protect the San Antonio Bay ecosystem, and human uses, I have been facilitating a stakeholder-driven effort to develop and implement a consensus-based management plan for this important estuarine system.\r\nLike many grass-roots programs, this one is characterized by a wealth of enthusiasm and a poverty of funding.  As one means of funding this program, I have started a campaign I call â€œStand UP for San Antonio Bay,â€ in which I am traversing regions of the bay system on a stand up paddleboard (SUP), then blogging about my adventures in pictures and essays, and asking readers to donate, to a local non-profit organization, some amount of money for each mile paddled.  \r\n','My blog, â€œStand UP for San Antonio Bay,â€ is account of my SUP adventures within San Antonio Bay system.  As I paddle, I take pictures and mental notes of what I see and what role these features play in the overall San Antonio Bay ecosystem.  I also record on my phoneâ€™s GPS the track of my paddle, which I can post on my blog in order to document the distance I cover.  For each event, I post a narrative of my experience, along with pictures and commentary on  protecting this wonderful place.\r\nHaving the opportunity to conduct a three-month series of paddling adventures would greatly facilitate my goal to document and spread the message about protecting both the ecological resources of San Antonio Bay as well as the quality and quantity of the fresh water in the San Antonio River and the Guadalupe River, both which flow into and nourish San Antonio Bay.  \r\nIf selected, SylvanSport and the Adventure Gear providers would be featured in my blog, both in text and in photos, as major sponsors.','http://standupforsanantoniobay.wordpress.com/','','','','361-6491518',59,1,'2012-04-24 19:18:02','2012-04-24 19:18:02','405 W.

I work as a raft guide part-time in WV but live in Michigan so I would stay in the GO when I travel down to work. Also, rafting has introduced me to some rad people that live all over the country and they do all sorts of outdoor adventures so I would take my GO and go visit them and take part in their adventures as well as start my own! I love to be outdoors doing seriously cool stuff but for the past six years I have been working towards my major of being a nurse. Next year is my final year of nursing school and I would love to take my GO and go ocean to ocean, Canada to Mexico, and visit all of my friends (and family) in between. I want to take photos of every place I visit and live life to the fullest so that when I have kids someday, I can share the experience with them and hopefully take them to see the world and open their horizons. One crazy trip on my brain is to find this small Mexican Restaurant in Pennsylvania that I heard is the last place to offer Surge, the Coca-Cola drink. It was taken off the market about 10 years ago but this place still has it! Road-trip!','I\'m a picture-taker for sure so I would document all of my travels. Also, if I didn\'t win the go, The other items would help in my travels around the world starting with my trip that will take place either this summer or next, to Africa. I plan on volunteering at a medical clinic in a rural area. I also want to raft the Zambezi river and go on a safari so that would be swell! I work at an outdoor retailer part-time and would post these photos to their website which would get the word out about different products to different customers! Just thinking about all those awesome goods and oh, the places I\'d go, I get so excited. The journey is the life, right?

Canâ€™t wait to open up the camper, roast some hot dogs and spend some time with everyone together!   From there we will travel through the Adirondacks and stop at Lake George.     Both of these places offer lots of opportunities for hiking, biking, fishing and swimming.  Next on to Saratoga Springs to take in all of God\'s beautiful vistas.    After a few days in nature, we will be ready for some roller coasters.   Hershey Park in Pennsylvania is where we will park the camper first; then on to the coasters at Cedar Point in Ohio.   Our last stop will be Lake Erie State Park in Brocton, NY.   \r\n	As a single dad, it has been a challenge to corral the kids for a synchronized family adventure.   It has been over seven years since our last family vacation.

A Sylvan Sport Go is so lightweight, even a compact car is able to drive with it. Iâ€™ve had vivid dreams of rounding a corner to see Mount Rushmore in all its glory. I hope one day I get to live out that dream. Domestic flights just donâ€™t produce the same experience driving Americaâ€™s roads would. They were built to be explored, but financial responsibilities to supporting my dad and sisters have derailed any plans to vacation. Winning a trailer would remedy that. Thereâ€™d be no financial excuse to not nostalgically explore all the places in my high school history textbooks. Iâ€™ve sat on the sidelines while all of my friends take road trips, and I long for the day I get Highway 50 all to myself. The seemingly endless stretch in view, the warm wind in my fingertips as it hangs out my window. A Sylvan Sport Go would also let me take my furry companion with me. When traveling itâ€™s difficult to provide a proper place to stay and hang out if my husband and I go on long hikes (heâ€™s a tiny guy) or tourist destinations that donâ€™t allow animals. I couldnâ€™t bear to leave his adventurous soul at home!','I love taking pictures, albeit I\'m not the best photographer in the world, but its fun! A photo blog would be essential.

Adventure can be on a mountain, river, or in your backyard!</p>\r\n<p>Our team brings decades of experience designing and making outdoor products from the most respected companies. We offer products that blend utility, quality, and value while respecting the purity of the places our adventures take us. Your never ending pursuit of adventure drives our passion to make cool stuff.</p>\r\n<p>We\'ve had some great help and support along the way. We don\'t have room to mention everyone, but below are a few links to contributing companies.</p>\r\n<h2>Contributing Companies</h2>\r\n<p>We collaborated with three of the most creative and experienced tent designers on the planet, and then teamed up with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kelty.com\">Kelty</a> to produce our structurally sound and strategically simple tent. We believe in Kelty\'s products so much that&nbsp;we now feature a custom assemblage of complementary camping gear, exclusively from Kelty, on the <a href=\"http://www.sylvansport.com/store\">SylvanSport Store</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The GO was designed to accomodate carrying and storage products from all of the major rack companies. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.yakima.com\">Yakima</a>, racks are of exceptional quality and design and we now feature them on the <a href=\"http://www.sylvansport.com/store\">SylvanSport Store</a>. We have a great collection of Yakima gear, assembled specifically&nbsp;to complement your GO.</p>\r\n<p>Settling into a comfortable, self-inflating air mattress from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pacoutdoor.com\">Pacific Outdoor Equipment</a>&nbsp;after a fun day of adventure is a great way to unwind. They come standard with every GO and fold neatly into the overhead storage for easy access.</p>\r\n<h2>Our People</h2>\r\n<p>Getting from point A to point B on a project as unique as this just doesn\'t happen unless you are teamed up with sharp minds, passionate spirits and dedicated people. Our silly humor also keeps us going through challenges and unexpected moments.</p>\r\n<h3><img class=\"imgLeft\" alt=\"\" src=\"/assets/Image/About-Us/1.11-About-Us-Our-People-Tom-D-1.jpg\" />Thomas Dempsey</h3>\r\n<p>Tom founded SylvanSport around his lifestyle.

They are hard working individuals who find the time to bring balance to their lives, never turning their backs on what drives them; riding, running and racing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visit our <a href=\"/play/events/eventlist\">event list</a> for a comprehensive overview of races and consumer shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Adventure Racing Team</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><img src=\"/assets/Image/Team/1.13-Team-2.jpg\" class=\"imgLeft\"/>Tracy Broeckel</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Tracy, age 30, born and raised in Saskatchewan, Canada is a personal fitness trainer in Buford, Ga. She started Adventure Racing in 2002, and since then has competed in over 14 different adventure races ranging from 3 hours to 30 hours in 6 different states. She is also an avid runner and biker on both road and trail. Since beginning her race career in 2002, she has run more than 16 road and trail races, 2 duathlons, three Â½ ma rathons and 2 full marathons. She has received medals in all racing venues most notably 2nd overall female division in her first duathlon, 1st in her age group in her second duathlon, and 1st in her age group in her first off road trail race placing her 5th overall in the womenâ€™s division. As captain of the SylvanSport Adventure Racing team, she leads the way for her two male teammates: David White and Jeff Scott.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>David White<img src=\"/assets/Image/Team/1.13-Team-4.jpg\" class=\"imgRight\"/></h3>\r\n<p>David, age 42, an Atlanta native now living in Buford, GA is an IT Consultant and avid outdoorsman, runner, and biker. After training with Tracy, David got a lot more serious about running/biking and last year, and competed in his first Â½ marathon, first full marathon, two triathlons, and a duathlon. Though never finishing near a top spot like Tracy, he had a ton of fun and decided that Adventure Racing was really the way to go for him since it combines so many different sports that he already loved to perform individually. He has now competed in half a dozen adventure races and has pushed his best friend, Jeff Scott, into becoming the third member of their team.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Jeff Scott</h3>\r\n<p>Jeff, age 40, an Atlanta native now living in Flowery Branch, GA is a small business owner who owns and operates DTI Security. Like David, he is also an avid outdoorsman, runner and biker. As best friends, he and David have spent a lot of time together in the outdoors doing all of the active sports they so enjoy... hunting, fishing, hiking, skiing, etc.. As such, it was any easy decision for Jeff to become a member of the Adventure Racing team since he is always looking for a new challenge. Last year, Jeff competed in his first Â½ marathon, first full marathon, four triathlons, and a duathlon. He has now competed in three adventure races and looks forward to great season as part of the SylvanSport Adveture Racing team.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cycling Team</h2>\r\n<h3><img src=\"/assets/Image/Team/1.13-Team-1.jpg\" class=\"imgLeft\"/>Jeff Parker</h3>\r\n<p>Some of Jeff\'s accomplishments include NC State road race champion, NC State cyclcross champion (don\'t remember the years), Ironman finisher, Adventure races with a 2nd at SOAR (a 12 hr race) as a solo racer and 1st as a three man team and 3rd overall at OMAR (a 30 hr race). Some of the races he will be competing in: The NC State RR, French Broad cycling classic stage race, Assualt on Mt. Mitchell MTB, The Greenville Classic Criterium races, The Upstate AR in Oct. (30 hr. race).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Greg Batt</h3>\r\n<p>Greg competes yearly in the Southeast Regional Championship Series mountain bike races and occasional road events like the Assault on Mt. Mitchell.

Ever.</h1>\r\n<h2>SylvanSport GO: reinventing how we carry gear and camp from the ground up.</h2>\r\n<p>This is the most unique camping and travel trailer you\'ll ever find. GO was designed from the frame out to be a one-of-a-kind mobile adventure trailer that\'s even more versatile than a Swiss Army knife. It\'s lightweight and easy to manage in the parking lot, garage or on the road. Weighing in at 840 lbs, GO can be pulled by even the smallest cars. Best of all, GO is imagined, designed, engineered, created and assembled right here in America. GO is extremely well made and crafted to last.</p>\r\n<p>Beyond its beautiful surface you\'ll find that no design element was left untouched. The tent sets up in minutes and stows cleanly into the roof\'s storage box. It also comes equipped with a weather-tight gear box that locks to keep your weekend camping essentials secure and ready for whenever you go.</p>\r\n<p>Click on this link to see a <a class=\"vimeo\" href=\"http://vimeo.com/21757560\" target=\"_blank\">short video</a> or read on to see why GO is in a class all its own. We also have <a href=\"/assets/File/go_specs.zip\">downloadable</a> technical drawings illustrating \'GO\'s dimensions as well as sleeping, eating and seating configurations.</p>\r\n<p><strong>GO is for fun</strong>. Our crack design team made GO selfishly for themselves. But I guess that&rsquo;s okay, because like a lot of us, they\'re into every imaginable outdoor pursuit. We love to camp, boat, bike, surf, sleep, and indulge in just about any other activity that includes family, friends, adventure and fun.</p>\r\n<p><strong>GO is flexible</strong>. Mobile Adventure Gear is more than a trailer. Like a Transformer&trade;, it changes from a sleek, low-profile, you-hardly-know-it&rsquo;s-there trailer, to an ATV-hungry hauler, to a secure, comfy camp in just minutes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>GO carries the load</strong>. It easily hauls, stores and organizes all of your toys, from boats, to bikes, to moto-machines and even tools and garden gear. So whether it&rsquo;s a spur-of-the-moment mini vacation or a trip to the home improvement megastore, GO works. And it&rsquo;s smart!</p>\r\n<p><strong>GO gets around</strong>. With its LED lighting, custom wheels with high-floatation tires, and intelligent suspension geometry, GO is easy to hook up to your tow vehicle and easy to tow&mdash;even by first-time-towers.</p>\r\n<p><strong>GO light</strong>. At 840 lbs. GO can be towed by almost any vehicle out there. This efficient &lsquo;backpack on wheels&rsquo; allows you to have the benefits of an RV without the gas credit card.</p>\r\n<p><strong>GO knows</strong>. From GO&rsquo;s hyper-engineered&trade; all-aluminum frame, to its Thule-compatible rack system, to its Kelty tent structure, GO is the most refined small towable ever.</p>\r\n<p><strong>GO ships from our factory ready to hit the road!</strong></p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/assets/Image/Product-Details/1.41-Product-Details-Collage-1.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<h2>TRAILER FEATURES</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Low profile design for minimum drag and super fuel efficiency</li>\r\n    <li>All aluminum, fully tig-welded, hyper-engineered&trade; frame</li>\r\n    <li>Torsion suspension for smooth load control</li>\r\n    <li>Very light weight at 840 lbs.</li>\r\n    <li>13&rdquo; ground clearance and high flotation tires for off-road use</li>\r\n    <li>UV resistant plastic storage boxes for years of maintenance free watertight storage</li>\r\n    <li>Waterproof gear storage in top camping pod</li>\r\n    <li>Lockable waterproof gear storage in front storage pod</li>\r\n    <li>Rack system frees up space from your tow vehicles&rsquo; roof rack</li>\r\n    <li>Rack system compatible with Thule, Yakima, Malone and all other major brand accessories</li>\r\n    <li>1000 lb. load capacity</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Control-Tilt&trade; cargo bed with pneumatic dampening system</li>\r\n    <li>Easy to own with very low-maintenance</li>\r\n    <li>Excellent suspension geometry and handling characteristics make it easy to tow</li>\r\n    <li>Self lubricating hubs</li>\r\n    <li>Cast aluminum wheels</li>\r\n    <li>Spare tire</li>\r\n    <li>LED lighting for safer, long lasting service</li>\r\n    <li>Reinforced diamond-plate flooring for heavy loads (up to 1000 lbs)</li>\r\n    <li>Waterproof electrical system suitable for use as a small boat trailer</li>\r\n    <li>Multiple tie-down points</li>\r\n    <li>Multiple configurations for carrying gear</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>CAMPING FEATURES</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Innovative Kelty tent system</li>\r\n    <li>Insulated bed platforms for snug sleeping</li>\r\n    <li>Stargazing windows</li>\r\n    <li>Excellent ventilation</li>\r\n    <li>Custom self-inflating air mattress from Pacific Outdoor Equipment</li>\r\n    <li>Equal to a King-size and a half of sleeping surface</li>\r\n    <li>Secure entry awning with optional larger awning</li>\r\n    <li>Zippered entry/ screen door</li>\r\n    <li>Multiple living space configurations</li>\r\n    <li>Torsion Axle Suspension</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<table>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>SPECIFICATIONS</td>\r\n            <td>standard</td>\r\n            <td>metric</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>Interior Floor Dimension</td>\r\n            <td>48 x 84 in</td>\r\n            <td>121.92 x 1.22 cm</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>Trailer Size (closed travel mode)</td>\r\n            <td>138 x 74 x 51 in</td>\r\n            <td>3.42 x 1.88 x 1.29 m</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>Trailer Size (open travel mode)</td>\r\n            <td>138 x 74 x 79 in</td>\r\n            <td>3.42 x 1.88 x 2 m</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>Trailer Size (Camping Mode)</td>\r\n            <td>167 x 124 x 106 in</td>\r\n            <td>4.2 x 3.14 x 2.69 m</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>Weight (unloaded)</td>\r\n            <td>800 lbs</td>\r\n            <td>382 kg</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>Front Storage Capacity</td>\r\n            <td>9 cu ft</td>\r\n            <td>955 cu lt</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>Camping Pod Storage Capacity</td>\r\n            <td>15 cu ft</td>\r\n            <td>425 cu lt</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>Standing Height (camping mode)</td>\r\n            <td>87 in</td>\r\n            <td>2.2 m</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>',56),

Here\'s what&nbsp;a few&nbsp;of them have to say:</p>\r\n<p>We have been using our GO as a way to move my daughter\'s belongings to a new apartment in the Bronx. I had several people talking to me about the trailer...always a unique treat to talk about it. My daughter was amazed how versatile the GO is. As parking is at a premium by her apartment we unhitched the trailer to easily park it curbside to unload her gear. What a great piece of engineering. <b>- Ron, New York</b></p>\r\n<p>&quot;In the year that I\'ve had my GO I\'ve been on 13 trips. I think my most memorable was at Douthat State Park- a great place for mountain biking and sightseeing. It was stormy, rainy, windy- the park ranger first said we could be stuck in the campsite if the river overflowed. Several hours later he returned to let us know of tornado warnings!! We stuck it out and survived. Luckily we had great shelter in the GO!!!&quot; <b>- Nancy, Flemington, NJ.</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe shopped for our Outback 2.5i wagon last spring and coordinated the  purchase of our GO just after the purchase of our 2011 Subaru.&nbsp; We had  both in mind as &ldquo;the boomer toys of choice&rdquo;.&nbsp; We couldn&rsquo;t be more  elated&hellip;they are like biscuits and gravy, like strawberries and cream,  like sauerkraut on your bratwurst, like horseradish with roast beef.&nbsp;  Some things just work well together!&nbsp; The Subaru&rsquo;s rear deck complements  storage of camping/kayaking/biking supplies with the GO&rsquo;s hauling  abilities.&nbsp; Our mpg were hardly affected at all and visibility was not  hampered when towing, either in the travel or transport mode <b>- Michael, Bloomington, MN.</b></p>\r\n<p>We live in Tucson, I bought my GO 3 years ago for my two kids. I surprised my kids with a random trip to pick it up in Ohio and then disappeared into the Colorado Rockies for a couple weeks. We absolutely&nbsp;love it&hellip; since then it&rsquo;s been to Alaska, Key West, Michigan, Canada... twice, the Rockies and more.&nbsp;Every time that things attached to my car, people crowd around and want to talk about it. <b>- Dan, Tucson AZ</b></p>\r\n<p>Our whole family loved the Go. I loved how I could move it around by hand to get to a flat spot in a non-electric site within the campground. That never would have been possible for a traditional RV or pop-up. It really is a fantastic piece of gear. Thank you! - <b>Eben, Cincinnati OH</b></p>\r\n<p>Dear Mr. Dempsey, Thank you for showing us that small camper thing, it was really cool. I told my mom and dad about it and they liked it alot. I hope they buy one so I can try it out, and again thank you for showing us that camper. I hope I get one for Christmas. - Dear Mr. Dempsey, Thank you for showing us all that cool stuff you designed. I what to be an Industry al designer when I\'m older. My favorite thing we looked at was the tent trailer. The other stuff I\'ve seen before, but the tent trailer was awesome. I like it because it is bizaare. <b>- Brevard Middle School Students, (after Career-Day)</b></p>\r\n<p>Help! We\'re surrounded! We took our Go camping a few weeks ago and drew ridiculous crowds. Friends told friends, and pretty soon there was a steady stream filing past our campsite. Some just gawked as they walked by, but more than a few hardy souls stopped and asked,&quot;What IS that?&quot;&nbsp; When it came time to pack up and leave, my husband had a crowd of spectators numbering around 40. The universal consensus was that the Go was one of the coolest things people had ever seen, and we agree. It exceeded our expectations in every area. - <strong>Vicki, Grand Rapids MI</strong></p>\r\n<p><img class=\"imgLeft\" alt=\"\" src=\"/assets/Image/Testimonials/1.42-Testimonials-2.jpg\" />We just arrived home from our &quot;maiden voyage&quot; to Florida with our brand new GO. Try as we might we are finding it difficult, if not impossible, to suggest a design improvement. The GO is perfect. Our GO came through a 35 mph wind storm and flooding rains without any problem, the durability of the GO has been really impressive. It is easy to see that the GO was designed by some very smart people with keen foresight. Consider us very happy GO&nbsp;Owners! - <strong>Jim and Donna, Berea OH</strong></p>\r\n<p>We picked it up Wednesday in Sacramento. It is now three days old. We live on a ranch in Northern California and have been sleeping outside in our Go due to unusually high temperatures. We find it much more comfortable sleeping in our Go than inside the house at the present time. Towing the unit behind our Honda Element is a breeze. - <strong>Peter, Sacramento, CA</strong>.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"imgRight\" alt=\"\" src=\"/assets/Image/Testimonials/1.42-Testimonials-3.jpg\" />I thought you might be interested in some of these photos we took on our inaugural summer camping trip with the GO. We went to the Sawtooth range outside of Sun Valley, Idaho, the Grand Tetons, and Yellowstone. The GO worked like a charm and was a big hit with other campers. - <strong>Kristen, Burlingame CA</strong></p>\r\n<p>I made a deposit on the GO early in the year and picked up S/N 005 on April 23 at the plant. I got to meet many of the principals of the company--Tom Dempsey, Scott Wood, Kyle Mundt, Tom Reeder--as well as the production team that assembled my GO. It was by far the most memorable experience I have ever had picking up a purchase. What a great team, and I do hope their company succeeds! - <strong>Michael, Batesville IN</strong></p>\r\n<p><img class=\"imgLeft\" alt=\"\" src=\"/assets/Image/Testimonials/1.42-Testimonials-4.jpg\" />My wife and I own serial # 15. We have used it several times and are extremely pleased. It has stimulated a phenomenal amount if interest each time we used it. I think your idea is an excellent one and we are very pleased. - <strong>Elliott, Chatham NJ</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Took our &quot;Go&quot; to the Lion Country Safari Campground this weekend for our maiden voyage. Listened to the lions roar all night. One starts and then they all chime in. The roaring goes on for three minutes. Then all is quiet for an hour and then it starts again, worth a trip ...Three sets of campers came over to look and ask questions as we set up the &quot;GO.&quot; They all were impressed and wanted one!&nbsp; The &quot;Go&quot; was great to sleep in and pull. Plan to camp every weekend for the next few months and then go to the Smokies this summer. I\'m so glad you created the &quot;GO.&quot;- <strong>Robert, Boynton Beach FL</strong></p>',62),

The company was founded in Transylvania County in 2004, and makes what National Geographic Adventure calls, &ldquo;the coolest camper ever.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The SylvanSport GO was introduced in 2008, and hundreds have been delivered worldwide since then. The GO is a lightweight vehicle that can be towed behind just about any vehicle. It is made of aluminum and a variety of recycled and recyclable plastics, and whether you are a greenhorn camper or a seasoned troop leader, it makes camping comfortable, easy, and fun, allowing you to be the coolest camper ever!</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Up to this point, we&rsquo;ve used a number of contract companies in other states to provide parts and final assembly of our products.&rdquo; says Tom Dempsey, SylvanSport&rsquo;s founder. &ldquo;From the beginning, we&rsquo;ve visualized doing this all in Brevard, and we are very pleased to now bring all of our production activities here. We wanted to do this earlier, but the economic challenges of the past several years have made things</p>\r\n<p>Over the past few months, the company has also established its supply chain from primarily local or regional companies. At its new location on Commerce Street in Brevard, SylvanSport will fabricate aluminum frames, and perform all assembly and shipping operations.</p>\r\n<p>Dempsey says that starting and operating a business like SylvanSport from Brevard just makes sense.<br />\r\n&ldquo;Brevard, and our area is the perfect place to become the future hub for outdoor recreation industry companies. Traditionally, companies in this industry have thrived in places like Boulder, CO or Seattle. Our region has all the ingredients to be the center of action for the eastern US.</p>\r\n<p>Veteran Outdoor Industry executive and entrepreneur, Thomas Dempsey formed SylvanSport in 2004 to develop what he calls, &ldquo;Mobile Adventure Gear.&rdquo; The company is a group of visionary leaders from the Outdoor and Recreation Vehicle industries who see an emerging market for small, lightweight camping and gear trailers.</p>\r\n<p>The design team at SylvanSport has examined the evolution of camping and the traditional pop-up or folding camping trailer and they&rsquo;ve re-invented this product from the wheels up. &ldquo;We were frustrated with what&rsquo;s out there, in terms of carrying our gear.&rdquo; declared Tom Reeder, SylvanSport&rsquo;s chief engineer. They have developed a dramatic new &ldquo;Backpack on Wheels,&rdquo; that is designed for everyone from active outdoor enthusiasts who want to carry their kayaks, mountain bikes, etc to young families with children, to sportsmen with gear carrying and camping desires. They expect to introduce their first product later this year through Outdoor Product Retail stores and select RV dealers. This product is vastly different from traditional RVs and will be marketed and distributed differently.</p>\r\n<p>In 2000, Dempsey along with a group of associates from the kayaking industry formed Liquidlogic, a kayak maker in Henderson County. He has a demonstrated track record of developing Outdoor Products businesses in Western North Carolina.</p>\r\n<p>The Transylvania County Economic Development Office is targeting the Outdoor Industry in its strategic economic development plan. &ldquo;SylvanSport is exactly the type of company that we have been seeking to bring to the County,&rdquo; said Mark Burrows, Director of Planning and Economic Development. &ldquo;The Outdoor Recreation Industry continues to grow, and Transylvania County is in a great position to help SylvanSport grow this new business. We look forward to working with Tom and his team as they initially develop prototypes and ultimately start production of their new recreation vehicles.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Dempsey and the team at SylvanSport share a commitment to developing business in the Outdoor Industry that encourages responsible and respectful use of our outdoor resources. They are equally committed to developing SylvanSport into a successful part of the local economic community. Never has there been more electricity and confidence behind a singular company designed to make a difference.</p>\r\n<p>Please contact Thomas Dempsey at <a href=\"mailto:tom@sylvansport.com\">tom@sylvansport.com</a> or (828) 606-9003 for more information.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n#####<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>',87),

This approach works for picking up the trailer in the U.S. We are happy to arrange shipment of the GO to a border town convenient to you, or you can pick it up directly at our factory in Sidney, OH. If you would like us to ship the trailer directly to you, please contact us as it will involve a different process and is more costly.<br />\r\nIn order to make it easy for you, we have outlined the process below. All the critical items you have to accomplish are highlighted in RED. If you would like more detailed information, visit the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.riv.ca/\">Registrar of Imported Vehicles (RIV) web site</a>. Since the GO weighs only 748 kg (840 lbs), it is not subject to the more rigorous import requirement.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><b>Purchase: </b></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>a. Bill of Sale: This will establish the trailer value for calculating the taxes due (see below)<br />\r\nb. U.S. Statement of Compliance: A label affixed to the trailer to document the compliance with governing regulations.<br />\r\nc. VIN (Vehicle Identification Number): A unique 17 digit number assigned to your particular trailer. It is listed on the label affixed to the trailer tongue and will be listed on the Title document and Bill of Sale.<br />\r\nd. Title: Document that proves you are the owner of the trailer.<br />\r\ne. Recall Clearance Letter: A document that states there are no outstanding recalls associated with the GO. This is necessary for importation.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>2. Two items you will need to consider obtaining prior to picking up the GO.a. Insurance binder: Check with your insurance company to determine if your trailer will be covered under your policy. Some insurance plans will not cover the trailer until it has been registered.</li>\r\n    <li><b>At The Border </b></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>a. $195 fee for RIV (this includes the inspection fee)<br />\r\nb. GST based on the Bill of Sale value<br />\r\nc. In some cases, other provincial taxes depending on point of entry.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>1. You will have 30 days to have the trailer inspected. Canadian Tire typically performs this service. Make sure you have your paper work (including the recall clearance letter) with you. There is no cost for the inspection as it was covered by the RIV fee you paid at the border. The inspector will stamp the Form 1.</li>\r\n    <li>2. Visit the local licensing office with all remaining paperwork in hand along with proof of insurance information.

We designed it so that one person could set it up in just a few minutes. This <a href=\"http://youtu.be/cNqDQ9MhMk0\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> will take you through the exact steps.</p>\r\n<h3>Q: Can I tow it with a small car?</h3>\r\n<p>You sure can. The GO trailer weight (unloaded) is only 840 lbs, so you can easily pull it with a small vehicle or even a hybrid.</p>\r\n<h3>Q: How many road or mountain bikes will it hold?</h3>\r\n<p>You can carry four bikes on top by adding a third-party rack system. If you convert the GO to ATV mode, you can carry many, many more.</p>\r\n<h3>Q: How many kayaks can it hold?</h3>\r\n<p>You can easily stow two smaller kayaks underneath. By adding a third-party rack system, you can carry two to six kayaks depending on how carefully you tie them down.</p>\r\n<h3>Q:Where can I go to learn more about accessorizing my GO?</h3>\r\n<p>Visit the <a href=\"/go/go-play/\">play</a> section of our site. You also might want to sign up on our mailing list at the bottom of this page, so we can let you know about other ideas as they come out.</p>\r\n<h3>Q: What is the best way for me to clean and care for my GO?</h3>\r\n<p>Cleaning is simple. Treat GO as you would your car, washing it with soap and water. The front storage pod and fenders are made of durable, recyclable polyethylene (LDPE) and will hold up to virtually all cleaning products.</p>\r\n<p>The tent can be washed using a mild cleaner like Woolite&reg;. A simple sponge and cleaner will work in most instances. If you need to remove the tent for a full cleaning, be sure to remove all poles and use a front loading washer that does not have an agitator.</p>\r\n<p>As for maintenance, just make sure that you lube your hubs (theself-lubricating bearings make this super easy). Check your tire pressure,and make sure the lug nuts are tight before each trip. See your owner&rsquo;smanual for more extensive details, or contact us for help.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>',101),

What was once a sport exclusively for the youthful extreme sports athlete, the kayak is now enjoyed by hobbyists of all ages. One of the challenges of any outdoor sport requiring large equipment such as a kayak or mountain bike is transportation of the equipment. The SylvanSport GO is a multipurpose outdoor gear trailer capable of carrying multiple kayaks and most other outdoor gear and equipment. Calling GO a Kayak trailer is somewhat restrictive, as our trailer can carry bikes, surfboards, camping equipment, skiis, and much more. That said, GO makes for a perfect kayak trailer and kayakers make up a large portion of our  customers.</p>\r\n<h2>Carry up to 10 Kayaks in the GO Kayak Trailer</h2>\r\n<p>One of the challenges of kayaking with a large group of friends is that you can only fit a few kayaks on the top of most vehicles. This dilemma typically requires several vehicles to travel with several kayaks on the roof of each. With the SylvanSport GO kayak trailer you can transport up to 10 kayaks at once with one vehicle. In fact the Go is so lightweight and nimble that it can be toed by virtually any vehicle including the Toyota Prius or a Mini Cooper. You can also mix and match outdoor gear by carrying several kayaks along with other outdoor gear allowing for multi-day, multi-sport outdoor excursions. What more could you ask for from your kayak trailer?</p>\r\n<h2>This Kayak Trailer Converts to a Full Service Pop up Camping Trailer</h2>\r\n<p>Another advantage of the SylvanSport GO kayak trailer is that it converts into a spacious camping tent upon arrival at your final destination. In other words GO is a kayak trailer and pop up tent camper in one. This makes GO perfect for the mobile adventurer who wants to get out and kayak and camp without the hassle of trying to fit all that gear into a car or SUV.</p>\r\n<h2>The Perfect Kayak Trailer for any Outdoor Enthusiast</h2>\r\n<p>One of the things that makes GO so unique is that it can be called by so many names. Some call it their kayak trailer, while others use it as an ATV trailer or surfboarding trailer. Some even use it for simple construction projects and other domestic hauling purposes. Once parked GO can quickly and easily be converted into a large, roomy tent camper capable of sleeping four people comfortably. We don\'t feel that it is an exaggeration to call GO the ultimate trailer for outdoor enthusiasts. In fact, we didn\'t have to say it, National Geographic actually dubbed our trailer the <i>coolest. camper. ever.</i></p>\r\n<p><img width=\"432\" height=\"311\" src=\"/assets/Image/search%20term%20images/kayaks%20loaded%201.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p><img width=\"432\" height=\"288\" src=\"/assets/Image/search%20term%20images/rogoscene3.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>',171),

Unfortunately over time the simple act of having fun has been replaced with complicated and expensive gear, bigger and more burdensome tent trailers. Luckily SylvanSport understands the need for low-impact enjoyment. That&rsquo;s why we designed the SylvanSport GO.

Like Matt from Virginia who says &ldquo;The Go is more than just a pop up camper, it is a versatile piece of gear! It can be used as a utility trailer, I used my Go to move into my new house, did not need to rent a truck. I used it to move a piano that I sold. It can be towed by almost anything, compatible with all major rack company systems! Show me something else that is as well built, made in America, has as much versatility, and can be towed by a Subaru Outback, there isn&rsquo;t anything! These trailers are amazing easy up and down, keep you off the ground, very well ventilated, hold up in high winds, keep you dry in torrential downpours, accommodate tall people. It is just incredible!!!&rdquo; Or Michael from Minnesota who writes &quot;We shopped for our Subaru Outback 2.5i wagon last spring and coordinated the purchase of our GO just after the purchase of our 2011 Subaru.&nbsp; We had both in mind as \'the boomer toys of choice\'.&nbsp; We couldn&rsquo;t be more elated&hellip;they are like biscuits and gravy, like strawberries and cream, like sauerkraut on your bratwurst, like horseradish with roast beef.&nbsp; Some things just work well together!&nbsp; The Subaru Outback\'s rear deck complements storage of camping/kayaking/biking supplies with the GO&rsquo;s hauling abilities.&nbsp; Our mpg were hardly affected at all and visibility was not hampered when towing, either in the travel or transport mode&quot;. There is no doubt, if you are a Subaru Outback owner, the GO is the ultimate Subaru Outback camper!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img width=\"431\" height=\"303\" alt=\"\" src=\"/assets/Image/search%20term%20images/subaru%202.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p><img width=\"432\" height=\"293\" src=\"/assets/Image/search%20term%20images/subaru%201.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p><img width=\"432\" height=\"287\" src=\"/assets/Image/search%20term%20images/rogoscene1.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>',178),

If you are looking for a cool, spacious and comfortable camper then GO is perfect, it&rsquo;s the Swiss Army Knife of lightweight camper trailers.</p>\r\n<h3>Blaze a trail of convenience in GO lightweight camper trailers</h3>\r\n<p>If convenience is a big factor in your decision to buy a lightweight camper trailer, consider the SylvanSport GO your answer. By having the ability to load everything you carry onto the GO, and not inside or on the roof of your car you can use your car for comfort, not cargo. By keeping your GO packed and ready for adventure, you can take off at a moments notice, with very little packing&hellip; now that&rsquo;s convenience.</p>\r\n<h3>Sleek, elegant design makes GO lightweight camper trailers cheap to haul, easy to use</h3>\r\n<p>No other lightweight camper trailer in history has won more design, engineering and gear awards than the SylvanSport GO. While we are proud of this achievement, what it really points out is the success of all the features we engineered into GO, which make it elegant and easy to use. From GOs lightweight aluminum frame to its&rsquo; sleek aerodynamic profile, GO was designed to be easy for all users&hellip; novice to pro. Weighing only 800 lbs and traveling on a perfectly balanced suspension system, GO is easy, energy efficient and can be towed by even the smallest of cars.</p>\r\n<h3><!--[if gte mso

Camper. Ever.</h1>\r\n<h2>Herzlich Willkommen auf der Internetseite der Sylvansport Europa Vertretung. Diese Seite befindet sich derzeit im Aufbau. FÃ¼r weitere Informationen verweisen wir Sie auf die InternetprÃ¤senz:</h2>\r\n<p>This is the most unique camping and travel trailer you\'ll ever find. The GO was designed from the frame out to be a one-of-a-kind mobile adventure trailer that\'s even more versatile than a Swiss Army knife. It\'s lightweight and easy to manage in the parking lot, garage or on the road. Weighing in at 800 lbs, the GO can be pulled by even the smallest cars. Best of all, the GO is imagined, designed, engineered, created and assembled right here in America. GO is extremely well made and crafted to last. </p>\r\n<p>Beyond its beautiful surface you\'ll find that no design element was left untouched. The tent sets up in minutes and stows cleanly into the roof\'s storage box. It also comes equipped with a weather-tight gear box that locks to keep your weekend camping essentials secure and ready for whenever you go.</p>\r\n<p>Click on this link to see a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://vimeo.com/21757560\" class=\"vimeo\">short video</a> or read on to see why the GO is in a class all its own. We also have <a href=\"/assets/File/go_specs.zip\">downloadable</a> technical drawings illustrating the \'GO\'s dimensions as well as sleeping, eating and seating configurations.</p>\r\n<p><strong>GO is for fun</strong>. Our crack design team made the GO selfishly for themselves. But I guess that&rsquo;s okay, because like a lot of us, they\'re into every imaginable outdoor pursuit. We love to camp, boat, bike, surf, sleep, and indulge in just about any other activity that includes family, friends, adventure and fun.</p>\r\n<p><strong>GO is flexible</strong>. Mobile Adventure Gear is more than a trailer. Like a Transformer&trade;, it changes from a sleek, low-profile, you-hardly-know-it&rsquo;s-there trailer, to an ATV-hungry hauler, to a secure, comfy camp in just minutes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>GO carries the load</strong>. It easily hauls, stores and organizes all of your toys, from boats, to bikes, to moto-machines and even tools and garden gear. So whether it&rsquo;s a spur-of-the-moment mini vacation or a trip to the home improvement megastore, GO works. And it&rsquo;s smart!</p>\r\n<p><strong>GO gets around</strong>. With its LED lighting, custom wheels with high-floatation tires, and intelligent suspension geometry, GO is easy to hook up to your tow vehicle and easy to tow&mdash;even by first-time-towers.</p>\r\n<p><strong>GO light</strong>. At 800 lbs. GO can be towed by almost any vehicle out there. This efficient &lsquo;backpack on wheels&rsquo; allows you to have the benefits of an RV without the gas credit card.</p>\r\n<p><strong>GO knows</strong>. From GO&rsquo;s hyper-engineered&trade; all-aluminum frame, to its Thule-compatible rack system, to its Kelty tent structure, GO is the most refined small towable ever.</p>\r\n<p><strong>GO ships from our factory ready to hit the road!</strong></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/assets/Image/Product-Details/1.41-Product-Details-Collage-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<h2>TRAILER FEATURES</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Low profile design for minimum drag and super fuel efficiency</li>\r\n    <li>All aluminum hyper-engineered&trade; frame</li>\r\n    <li>Torsion suspension for smooth load control</li>\r\n    <li>Very light weight at 800 lbs.</li>\r\n    <li>13&rdquo; ground clearance and high flotation tires for off-road use</li>\r\n    <li>UV resistant plastic storage boxes for years of maintenance free watertight storage</li>\r\n    <li>Waterproof gear storage in top camping pod</li>\r\n    <li>Lockable waterproof gear storage in front storage pod</li>\r\n    <li>Rack system frees up space from your tow vehicles&rsquo; roof rack</li>\r\n    <li>Rack system compatible with Thule, Yakima, and other brand accessories</li>\r\n    <li>800 lb. load capacity</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Control-Tilt&trade; cargo bed with hydraulic dampening system</li>\r\n    <li>Easy to own with very low-maintenance</li>\r\n    <li>Excellent suspension geometry and handling characteristics make it easy to tow</li>\r\n    <li>Self lubricating hubs</li>\r\n    <li>Cast aluminum wheels</li>\r\n    <li>Spare tire</li>\r\n    <li>LED lighting for safer, long lasting service</li>\r\n    <li>Reinforced diamond-plate flooring for heavy loads</li>\r\n    <li>Waterproof electrical system suitable for use as a small boat trailer</li>\r\n    <li>Multiple tie-down points</li>\r\n    <li>Multiple configurations for carrying gear</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>CAMPING FEATURES</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Innovative Kelty tent system</li>\r\n    <li>Insulated bed platforms for snug sleeping</li>\r\n    <li>Stargazing windows</li>\r\n    <li>Excellent ventilation</li>\r\n    <li>Custom self-inflating air mattress from Pacific Outdoor Equipment</li>\r\n    <li>Equal to a King-size and a half of sleeping surface</li>\r\n    <li>Secure entry awning with optional larger awning</li>\r\n    <li>Zippered entry/ screen door</li>\r\n    <li>Multiple living space configurations</li>\r\n    <li>Torsion Axle Suspension</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<table>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>SPECIFICATIONS</td>\r\n            <td>standard</td>\r\n            <td>metric</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>Interior Floor Dimension</td>\r\n            <td>48 x 84 in</td>\r\n            <td>121.92 x 1.22 cm</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>Trailer Size (closed travel mode)</td>\r\n            <td>138 x 74 x 51 in</td>\r\n            <td>3.42 x 1.88 x 1.29 m</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>Trailer Size (open travel mode)</td>\r\n            <td>138 x 74 x 79 in</td>\r\n            <td>3.42 x 1.88 x 2 m</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>Trailer Size (Camping Mode)</td>\r\n            <td>167 x 124 x 106 in</td>\r\n            <td>4.2 x 3.14 x 2.69 m</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>Weight (unloaded)</td>\r\n            <td>800 lbs</td>\r\n            <td>382 kg</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>Front Storage Capacity</td>\r\n            <td>9 cu ft</td>\r\n            <td>955 cu lt</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>Camping Pod Storage Capacity</td>\r\n            <td>15 cu ft</td>\r\n            <td>425 cu lt</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>Standing Height (camping mode)</td>\r\n            <td>87 in</td>\r\n            <td>2.2 m</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>',200),

It transforms from a sleek gear carrying trailer&nbsp; into a spacious above-ground camper in a snap, or rather a crank. The sleek elegant body is crafted in the mountain country of Western North Carolina, USA, all tig-welded and assembled from heavy duty aluminum for a secure lightweight haul as well as durability. SylvanSport designed the GO tow behind trailer from the ground up to be as versatile as possible, yet easy to use. The GO is lightweight which helps reduce the eco footprint, so lightweight in fact, that even a Prius can tow a GO tow behind trailer.</p>\r\n<h3>Bring the Adventure in the GO Tow Behind Trailer</h3>\r\n<p>Imagine, if you will, a summer journey.
